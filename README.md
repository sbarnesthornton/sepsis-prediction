# Early Prediction of Sepsis Using Clinical Data
A data science project aiming to analyse electronic health records, producing models to help with the early prediction of sepsis. Part of the applied data science unit at the University of Bristol.

This repository contains all of the code used in our work, from pre-processing to building models and visualising results on the dashboard. We have not carefully documented everything, as this is intended more to give an idea of the scale of work we completed. However, the dashboard directory includes all instructions required to deploy the dashboard.
