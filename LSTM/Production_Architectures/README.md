# How to run LSTM models
1. Make sure you are running python within an environment with the following dependencies installed
   - sklearn
   - pytorch
   - numpy
   - pandas
2. Run `python train_lstm.py` to train and then test the model. During training statistics will be printed to the command line, including validation and test scores
(if you don't have the datasets then reach out to the team - the csv files are each too large for our github quota)
